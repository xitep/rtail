* Logic based on the 'Expired' header
  - Need to adjust for the time difference between server and client
    based on the "Date" header field from the previous request

* Support specifying lines instead of bytes only.
  - We can achieve operating on line level by getting a little bit more
    data bytes and then filtering within the application before producing
    outout.

* Support a --continue option together with --output <file> ... to
  automatically start fetching the remote resource as of the offset
  of the named output file and then append to the file (instead of
  overriting it as now).  In the same spirit as wget's -c.

* Support a --separator option to print some separator between
  served chunks of data.
